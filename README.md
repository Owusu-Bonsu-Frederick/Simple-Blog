This project is a simple e-commerce website for a simple diner or restaurant. It does not have a database attached to it but rather simulates one using the browser's cache.
It includes a login page, a homepage, menu page, a dynamic menu page and cart with an order form and a page for past orders.

This project was implemented using html, css and vanilla javascript. It is suitable for demo of similar sites and can easily be adjusted to fit your needs as it is well commented.

It simulates and functions as any fully built one would.
